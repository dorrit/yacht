Yacht Dice
=====

Yacht is another dice game, similar to the popular game Yahtzee. Each player rolls five dice at a time and hopes for one of the following combinations:

four of a kind, worth the sum of the four dice;
full house (three of a kind and a pair), worth 25;
straight (five sequential dice), worth 40; or
yacht (five of a kind), worth 50.
Any other combination is worth zero.

The game lasts for thirteen turns.
